.. Oh hey, I see what you did there.

   Embarrassing how much html there was in this 'plain text' file at some point.
   Luckily a dash of Javascript and CSS fixed it up.
   This was made with care.
   Key players were Python, Sphinx, reST, Bootstrap, Make, tmux, vim, zsh and Firefox.

Personal
====================================================================

:Hiking:
    Indiana is full of great parks, even in the city.
    I like to get out and enjoy nature.
:Music:
    I grew up with a living room full of vinyl records.
    All the Classic Rock and Jazz you could dream of.
    Consequently, I spend a lot of time searching for and listening to new music.
    If one of my favorite bands is in town, you'll definitely find me at the show.
:Brewing:
    I really enjoy the technical aspects of the process.
    It also allows for a lot of creativity while designing new beers.
    It is still kind of surreal that I can pull a beer out of my fridge, that I made.
