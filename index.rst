.. Oh hey, I see what you did there.

   Embarrassing how much html there was in this 'plain text' file at some point.
   Luckily a dash of Javascript and CSS fixed it up.
   This was made with care.
   Key players were Python, Sphinx, reST, Bootstrap, Make, tmux, vim, zsh and Firefox.

Personal
====================================================================

:Outdoors:
    Indiana is full of great parks, even in the city.
    I like to get out for a hike or go disc golfing.
:Music:
    I grew up with a living room full of vinyl records.
    All the Classic Rock and Jazz you could dream of.
    Consequently, I spend a lot of time searching for and listening to new music.
    If one of my favorite bands is in town, you'll definitely find me at the show.
    Mostly obsessed with playing modular synths these days.
:Brewing:
    I really enjoy the technical aspects of the process.
    It also allows for a lot of creativity while designing new beers.
    It is still kind of surreal that I can pull a beer out of my fridge, that I made.
